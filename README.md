# ApeShitFuckJacked

Yeah, writing this (again), using graphQL/Relay, let's see if I can actually get it working. 

It'd make a crapton more sense to just get this going with react native and parse or some precooked backend, but what would I learn then eh?

## To load db

```
$ psql -f scriopts/createdb.sql apeshitfuckjacked
```
